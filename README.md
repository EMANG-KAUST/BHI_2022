#  Spectrogram Image-based Machine Learning model for Carotid-to-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity Estimation using PPG signal (BHI conference 2022)

In this repository you can find the implementation presented in the paper Spectrogram Image-based Machine Learning model for Carotid-to-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity
Estimation using PPG signal.

In the BHI-conference forder, you can find the implementation of the different features extraction types in matlab and the corresponding implementation of ML models
in python. In order to use the codes you need to follow the next steps:

1- Select the .m file corresponding to the different feature extraction methods.
2- Select the level of noise desired as SNR (In the paper we present the result with Noise-free , 20 dB, 15 dB, 10 dB).
3- Run the .m file (You don't need to run the .py code).
